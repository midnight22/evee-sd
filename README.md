## Budget

The budget for this project will vary each month. For May, we currently have $500 remaining to finish a few small tasks to deploy our full end-to-end from indexing a single site, to viewing the results in our UI.
## Current Tasks

1. Event indexers - find and reference event data found on other sites
2. Data formatting - format dates so that events can be sorted chronologically
3. API - allow UI to access events from server
4. Event Loader - move staged index of events to the live database and archive the previous index of events
5. UI - responsive UI that shows all events in chronological order
